# larinova/ops

Non-technical subdir of the larinova project. Business, strategy, creative, sales, outreach, ops tooling — no application code, no deploys.

## Why this subdir exists

The main `larinova/` repo holds app code (Next.js apps for `app.larinova.com`, `larinova.com`, `patient.larinova.com`). Ops-side MCPs (Gmail, WhatsApp) would bleed into coding sessions and pollute context if loaded at repo root. So they live here: Claude Code walks **up** from the current working dir to find `.mcp.json`, so `ops/.mcp.json` is only visible when your CWD is inside `ops/`. When you `cd` into `app/` or `landing/`, it is invisible.

**Net effect:**
- `cd ~/Documents/products/larinova` (code work) → only `.mcp.json` at repo root loads (Context7). No Gmail/WhatsApp noise.
- `cd ~/Documents/products/larinova/ops` (ops work) → Claude Code sees `ops/.mcp.json` (Gmail) in addition. WhatsApp CLI available via Bash.

## Cross-references to code

Strategy docs reference app behavior (pricing, whitelist, landing features). When a strategy doc prescribes a code change, `cd ..` to the repo root to execute it. Don't try to edit code from here — Cursor/Claude Code should be restarted at the root when switching modes.

## Current focus (April 2026)

- **Indonesia launch** — primary. Meeting doctors IRL, collecting testimonials, then cold outreach to ~50 hospital leads.
- **India** — secondary market, maintained but not actively launching.
- **Offer**: 1 month free, full access, no credit card. Same everywhere.
- **Active spec** (in the code side of this repo): `../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-india-opd-platform-design.md`.

## Key strategy docs

- `strategy/INDONESIA_PLAYBOOK.md` — Indonesia GTM
- `strategy/INDIA_PLAYBOOK.md` — India (Chennai) GTM
- `strategy/GO_TO_MARKET.md` — cross-market notes
- `strategy/AGENT_WORKFORCE.md` — AI agent workforce strategy
- `strategy/SIGDA_OPTIMA_FORM_SPEC.md` — competitor form spec
- `docs/SALES_OUTREACH_PLAN.md` — sales strategy & outreach templates
- `docs/PRICING_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — future tiered pricing
- `docs/Competitive_Research_Report.html` — competitor analysis
- `docs/india/pricing-strategy.html` + `docs/indonesia/pricing-strategy.html` — per-market pricing rationale (build PDFs with `docs/build.sh`)

## Conventions (inherited from repo root)

- All user-facing CTAs link to `https://app.larinova.com`.
- Email sender is always `hello@larinova.com`.
- Canonical domain is `larinova.com`.
- Any Indonesian text in internal docs carries an English translation alongside.

## MCPs / tools

- **Gmail** — local MCP via `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`, scoped to `gabrielantony56@gmail.com`. Setup in `README.md`. Not active until OAuth credentials file is placed at `.gmail-credentials.json` and the `_gmail_disabled` key is renamed to `gmail` in `.mcp.json`.
- **WhatsApp** — not an MCP. `whatsapp/` holds a CLI. Use via Bash: `cd whatsapp && npm run list` / `npm run send -- --to=<jid> --text="…"`.

## Skills / plugins

Install ops-relevant skills into `.claude/` at this level — they will not leak into the code side of the repo because Claude Code resolves skill config per-CWD. Candidates: readme, pitch-deck-builder, notion-api, youtube-transcript, seo. Keep code-oriented skills (TDD, playwright, supabase) at the repo root.
